"What is the SI unit of force?",Joule,Newton,Watt,Pascal,B,"The SI unit of force is the Newton (N), named after Sir Isaac Newton. One Newton is the force required to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at 1 meter per second squared.",easy,1,2
"What is the speed of light in vacuum?",300000 km/s,150000 km/s,450000 km/s,600000 km/s,A,"The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second or 3 × 10^8 meters per second.",medium,1,2
"What does Newton's First Law of Motion state?",F=ma,Every action has an equal and opposite reaction,An object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by a force,Energy cannot be created or destroyed,C,"Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia) states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with the same velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.",medium,1,2
"What is the formula for kinetic energy?",mgh,1/2 mv^2,mc^2,Fd,B,"The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2 mv^2, where m is mass and v is velocity.",medium,1,2
"What type of energy does a compressed spring have?",Kinetic energy,Thermal energy,Potential energy,Chemical energy,C,"A compressed spring has elastic potential energy, which is a form of potential energy stored when an elastic object is stretched or compressed.",medium,1,2
"What is the unit of electrical resistance?",Ampere,Volt,Ohm,Coulomb,C,"The unit of electrical resistance is the Ohm (Ω), named after German physicist Georg Ohm.",easy,1,2
"According to Einstein's equation E=mc^2, what does 'c' represent?",Speed of sound,Speed of light,Gravitational constant,Planck's constant,B,"In Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation E=mc^2, 'c' represents the speed of light in vacuum.",medium,1,2
"What is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth?",8.9 m/s^2,9.8 m/s^2,10.5 m/s^2,11.2 m/s^2,B,"The acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared (9.8 m/s^2).",easy,1,2
"What is the principle of conservation of energy?",Energy can be created,Energy can be destroyed,Energy can be created or destroyed,Energy cannot be created or destroyed,D,"The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.",easy,1,2
"What is an ohm a measure of?",Current,Voltage,Resistance,Power,C,"An ohm is the unit of measurement for electrical resistance. It measures how much a material opposes the flow of electric current.",easy,1,2
